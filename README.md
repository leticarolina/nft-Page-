## Overview

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).

Doing this project has helped me to practice some tools I learned specially in CSS, I really like to comment my code while I work on a project, specially throught my learning process so my goal here was to genuinelly understand each line of code written and also

### The challenge

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me to learn how to align contents better as well as using the element <div> on a way that will make sense to apply the styles after. Some of the CSS selectors that I learned throught this process that really helped to solve the challange was:

```css
.box {
  display: flex; /*display elements side to side*/
}

.block2 {
  justify-content: space-between; /*space between the content throught the flex display*/
}
```
